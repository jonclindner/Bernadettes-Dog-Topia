### **_Description_**

### Inspired by many muddy paw prints, dirt on my couch and bed, and poorly-organized and unstructured lists and reviews from online sources, Bernadette's Dog-Topia provides a solution. This scratch-built, full-stack application allows users to create, view, update, and delete information regarding their favorite dog parks within the Denver Metro area. Unlike other review platforms, this information is structured to provide useful infomation such as the ground surface material, so viewers can choose a park to visit which will keep their dogs and homes as clean as possible.

### **_Getting Started_**

### To begin the application, I will create a new React app, complete all installs, connect to Mongoose, create my schema for the data, add data about parks in the area and decide on approximate styling for the page. I will then install Nodemon and set up Express folders, and create a way for the user to add, change, and delete data. Once the site is functional, styling will be the main priortity.
