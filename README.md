### **_Description_**

### An engaging, scratch-built, full-stack application. Once deployed, this website will allow users to interact with buttons, search bars, forms, and dropdowns to create, read, update, and delete data from a back-end database. The purpose of this application is to allow users to rate and comment on existing dog parks within the Denver Metro area, as well as create new parks that are not listed, and delete or edit the information about any park that is listed.

---

### **_Getting Started_**

### To begin the application, I will create a new React app, complete all installs, connect to Mongoose, create my schema for the data, add data about parks in the area and decide on approximate styling for the page. I will then install Nodemon and set up Express folders, and create a way for the user to add, change, and delete data. Once the site is functional, styling will be the main priortity.
