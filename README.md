### **_Description_**

### Inspired by many muddy paw prints, dirt on my couch and bed, and poorly-organized and unstructured lists of reviews from online sources, Bernadette's Dog-Topia provides a solution. This scratch-built, full-stack application allows users to create, view, update, and delete information regarding their favorite dog parks within the Denver Metro area. Unlike other review platforms, this information is structured to provide useful infomation such as the ground surface material, so viewers can choose a park to visit which will keep their dogs and homes as clean as possible.

### **_Getting Started_**

### Upon navigating to the home page, the user is greeted with a list of seeded parks and a navigation bar at the top of the screen. The user can click on any of the seeded parks to view more information, view any seeded reviews, and edit or delete the park. The user can also select "create a park" in the navigation bar and input information into the fields to create a new park. This new park will be displayed on the main page.
